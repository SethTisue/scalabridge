Hi ScalaBridge mentors,

Thanks for volunteering for the first ScalaBridge Boston workshop! I really appreciate your time and effort for making this happen!


I've created the workshop event on Meetup and BridgeTroll:

- https://www.meetup.com/ScalaBridge-Boston/events/251183790/
- https://www.bridgetroll.org/events/438


Please RSVP on both (especially BridgeTroll). BridgeTroll helps to collect mentors info. It is helpful for the students to know who and how many mentors there will be at the workshop. I'll share the event on Twitter. Please RT if you have a twitter account. Feel free to share this workshop with anyone you know! Anyone is welcome, regardless of their previous programming experience.


The workshop is scheduled on **August 5th from 10am to 5pm** at Hopper (
275 Third Street, Cambridge, MA 02142). I will send out a more detailed schedule once it is planned.


Rather than lecture-lab, this is a hands-on workshop designed for self-paced learning. As a volunteer, you will be a floating mentor, engaging and facilitating students in their learning. Here is the [curriculum](https://scalabridge.gitbooks.io/curriculum/content/). It will be helpful if you briefly read through it before the workshop.


Please do not hesitate to contact me for any questions or concerns.  Please also feel free to give suggestions on the event post and/ or the workshop schedule and/ or training content, etc. I look forward to working with you all and to creating a ScalaBridge community in Boston! :)


Best,

Yifan Xing
