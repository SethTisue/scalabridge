Hi All,

I am organizing a ScalaBridge workshop in Boston on August 5th. ScalaBridge is an inclusive community that introduces fundamentals of Scala to the minorities in the form of workshops. There are currently more than 130 people registered to attend. I would love to have more mentors for the workshop. 


ScalaBridge has a well-written [curriculum](https://scalabridge.gitbooks.io/curriculum/content/) available online. As a mentor, we'll need to show up for the workshop, go around and answer questions about Scala.


Here is the event info:

Please DM me [@yifan_xing_e](https://twitter.com/yifan_xing_e) or email me (xing.yif@husky.neu.edu) if you're interested in being a mentor!


I really look forward to the workshop and to bringing diversity to the community! :)


Best,

Yifan Xing
