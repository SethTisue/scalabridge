Hi there!

Thank you all for attending ScalaBridge workshop! We hope you enjoyed learning Scala. We had a lot of fun organizing this event and hope you had a fruitful and an inspiring experience. A big THANK YOU to our sponsors: iHeartRadio and Underscore!

If you would like to continue to learn about Scala, please check out the resources posted on this [website](https://scalabridge.gitbooks.io/curriculum/content/resources.html).

In order to support and improve our future events for you, we would love to hear your thoughts and your honest feedback. You should've received a survey from BridgeTroll. If you didn't, please let me know: xxx@gmail.com

Looking forward to seeing you at future ScalaBridge workshops! :)
