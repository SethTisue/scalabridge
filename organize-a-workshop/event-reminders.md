# Event Reminders

**Optimal start time of this step: 1 month before the workshop**


## Why send out reminders?
One of the best ways to ensure that you have a reasonable turn out for the workshop is to remind students and mentors about the event consecutively. Keep in mind that the usual turn out for the workshop is 50% of the people who registered for your event. You should also be prepared for people who did not register to show up.


## Who to remind?
1. Students
2. Mentors
Reminder emails should be sent out separately for the two different groups.


## One Month Before the event:
You would want to remind people of the workshop to ensure that they can still attend. Or to remind them to update their RSVP if they can no longer attend.

### What should be included in your reminder email?
1. Students
   
   Remind registered students of: 
   - Event date, time
   - Schedule
   - Goal of the workshop
   - Update RSVP is no longer can attend
   - (Optional) Mention/ thank sponsor
   - Your contact info for questions

2. Mentors:

   Remind registered mentors of:
   - Registration
   - Event date, time
   - Schedule
   - Goal of the workshop, what are they expected to do (how to help students)
   - Workshop flow
   - (Optional) Suggestions for mentorship if any
   - Your contact info for questions

## Two weeks before the event:
In addition to reminding people of the event, you should finalize the number of people who signed up for the event. :heavy_exclamation_mark: Give the final head count to the sponsor to prepare for  food and space.
